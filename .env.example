# ============================================================================
# Clusterio Docker Environment
# ============================================================================
# Single configuration file for the entire cluster.
# - Docker Compose reads this for ${VAR} interpolation in docker-compose.yml
# - Both controller and host containers receive these as environment variables
# - Unused variables in a container are harmlessly ignored
#
# Copy to .env:  cp .env.example .env

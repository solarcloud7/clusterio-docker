# On first run:
#   - Database files are copied BEFORE controller starts (users, roles)
#   - Mod .zips are uploaded to the controller via API
#   - Host folders must match docker-compose hostnames exactly
#   - Instance folders are created via API AFTER controller starts
#   - Any .zip files in instance folders are uploaded as saves
#   - Instances auto-start by default (override with config.json)
